Welcome to my repository, an archive of the projects I've done and am working on while at [42
## Finished Projects

I am proud to showcase my completed projects which allow me to see just how far I've come:

- **[libft + Bonus](https://github.com/moop250/libft)**: My first project for 42. A recreated standard C library with added utility functions to kickstart my projects.

- **[ft_printf](https://github.com/moop250/ft_printf)**: A versatile and efficient re-implementation of `printf`, supporting various specifiers for diverse output formatting needs.

- **[get_next_line](https://github.com/moop250/get_next_line)**: Tailor-made function to extract and return lines from given file descriptors, enhancing file parsing capabilities line by line.

- **[Born2beRoot + Bonus](https://github.com/moop250/born2beroot)**: A deep dive into system administration, mandating the conception of a secure and well-structured server environment.

- **[PushSwap + Bonus](https://github.com/moop250/push_swap)**: The epitome of algorithmic refinement, revolving around a constrained set of operations to sort data in minimal possible moves - featuring the "Turk algorithm".

- **[pipex + Bonus](https://github.com/moop250/pipex)**: This project revolves around UNIX concepts such as pipelines, process handling, and command executions. This project was tough but I imagine that it will have been worth the effort when I get to minishell.

- **[so_long + Bonus](https://github.com/moop250/so_long)**: This project was fun as hell, didnt quite get to do all that I wanted but im quite happy with all ive achived. 

- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/moop250/Philosophers)** I have a couple grey hairs from this project but it was very interesting, im probably gonna add multithreading to so_long.

- **[minishell](https://github.com/moop250/minishell)** My hair is now completely grey, this project took way too long, i cannot wait to start working on C++ ðŸ˜­
